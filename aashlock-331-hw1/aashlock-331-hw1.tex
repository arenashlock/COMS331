\begin{enumerate}

%----------------------------------- Q1 DONE -----------------------------------

\item Give a regular expression, simplified to the best of your abilities, for the language of \textbf{all} strings of $a$'s, $b$'s, and $c$'s where $a$ is never immediately followed by $b$.

We start with the expression: $(a + b + c)^*$.\\
However, we have to alter the term with '$a$' in it due to the problem description.\\
Therefore, we get $a^*c$ since every $a$ is followed either by an $a$ or $c$.\\
It's wrong to have $a^*c^*$ since we encompass consecutive $c$'s in the '$+ c$' term of the original expression.\\
\textbf{Answer:} $(a^*c + b + c)^*$

%----------------------------------- Q2 DONE -----------------------------------

\item Give a regular expression, simplified to the best of your abilities, for the language of \textbf{all} strings of $a$'s, $b$'s, and $c$'s that contain an even number of $b$'s.

We start with the expression: $(a + b + c)^*$.\\
However, we have to alter the term with '$b$' in it due to the problem description.\\
Therefore, we get $b(a + c)^*b$ since every $b$ must come in pairs with some amount (or no amount) of $a$'s and $c$'s in between.\\
\textbf{Answer:} $(a + b(a + c)^*b + c)^*$

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%----------------------------------- Q3 DONE -----------------------------------

\item Simplify (if possible) the expression $(a + b)^*(a + b + c)^*(a + b)^*$, then describe as concisely as you can in English the language it defines.

\textbf{Simplified:} $(a + b + c)^*$\\
\textbf{English:} The language of all strings of $a$'s, $b$'s, and $c$'s.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%----------------------------------- Q4 DONE -----------------------------------

\item Simplify (if possible) the expression $(a + b)^*c^*(a + b)^*$, then describe as concisely as you can in English the language it defines.

This expression \textbf{CANNOT} be simplified.\\
\textbf{English:} The language of all strings of $a$'s, $b$'s, and $c$'s where all $c$'s are consecutive.
